Check [Test documentation on Confluence](https://toptal-core.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SACQ/pages/2476737125/Testing+process+and+tools) for more detailed information about test automation levels and instructions.

## Unit tests

It will run unit test command on every package:

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

To be able to run unit tests on a specific package:

```bash
yarn test:unit --scope='package-name'
```

Check documentation about [Unit tests best practices](https://toptal-core.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SACQ/pages/2561835118/Unit+tests+best+practices) for more quality driven tests.

### Code coverage for unit tests

It will run separated code coverages command on every package:

```bash
yarn test:unit:coverage
```

To be able to run code coverage on a specific package:

```bash
yarn test:unit:coverage --scope='package-name'
```

Open the link is shown on the terminal, click on right up side "%Coverage" and check it up.

## End-to-end tests

`.env` file needs to have some environment variables:

```
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=******
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=******
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=******
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_API_URL=http://localhost:7777
NEXT_PUBLIC_FF_USER_AUTH=enabled
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://toptal:toptal@localhost:5432/hastebin
```

It will run e2e test command on next-app:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.db.yml up
yarn db:migrate:deploy && yarn db:seed
yarn turbo run start --filter=hastebin-server
yarn test:e2e
```

### Code coverage for end-to-end tests

It will run e2e code coverage command on next-app:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.db.yml up
yarn db:migrate:deploy && yarn db:seed
yarn turbo run start --filter=hastebin-server
yarn test:e2e:coverage
yarn nyc:report
```

Open html generated report on browser:

```bash

```bash
yarn install && yarn build
yarn happo run
```

You can compare runs between two commit hashes with:

```bash
yarn happo compare first-commit-hash second-commit-hash
```

You can run by test component with:

```bash
yarn happo run --only component-name
```
